# Jetpack Compose Project Structure Example

This project demonstrates the use of dependency injection in an Android application using Kotlin, Java, and Gradle. The project leverages Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and includes various features such as image loading with Coil, state management with Jetpack Compose, and more.

## Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/com/minizuure/dependencyinjection/`: Main application code.
- `app/src/main/java/com/minizuure/dependencyinjection/domain/`: Domain layer containing constants, entities, and repositories.
- `app/src/main/java/com/minizuure/dependencyinjection/ui/`: UI layer containing presentation logic and composables.
- `app/src/main/java/com/minizuure/dependencyinjection/zetsdevelopment/`: Mock implementations for testing and development.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: Using Dagger Hilt for managing dependencies.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI toolkit for building native interfaces.
- **Coil**: Image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Realm**: Mobile database for storing local data.
